For setting up a hypervisor on Ubuntu, **Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)** is widely regarded as the most straightforward option. KVM is integrated directly into the Linux kernel, allowing Ubuntu to function as a type-1 hypervisor without the need for additional installations.

**Setting Up KVM on Ubuntu:**

1. **Install Necessary Packages:**
   Open a terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
   ```
   This command installs KVM along with associated tools.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   Ensure your system supports virtualization and that KVM is properly installed by running:
   ```bash
   sudo kvm-ok
   ```
   A positive confirmation indicates that KVM acceleration can be utilized.

3. **Add User to 'libvirt' Group:**
   To manage virtual machines without superuser privileges, add your user to the 'libvirt' group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
   ```
   After executing this command, log out and log back in to apply the group changes.

4. **Launch Virtual Machine Manager:**
   Use the `virt-manager` GUI to create and manage virtual machines.
   Start it by searching for "Virtual Machine Manager" in your application menu or by running:
   ```bash
   virt-manager
   ```

This setup provides a robust virtualization environment on your Ubuntu system. 

Alternatively, **GNOME Boxes** offers a user-friendly interface for virtualization on Ubuntu. It's designed for quick setup and ease of use, making it suitable for users who prefer a simpler solution.

**Setting Up GNOME Boxes on Ubuntu:**

1. **Install GNOME Boxes:**
   Execute the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y gnome-boxes
   ```

2. **Launch GNOME Boxes:**
   After installation, open GNOME Boxes from your application menu.

3. **Create a New Virtual Machine:**
   Within GNOME Boxes, click the "+" button to create a new virtual machine.
   Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operating system image and configure the virtual machine settings.

This method offers a streamlined approach to virtualization, ideal for users seeking simplicity. 

Both KVM with `virt-manager` and GNOME Boxes are effective solutions for virtualization on Ubuntu. Your choice may depend on your specific needs and familiarity with virtualization tools.
